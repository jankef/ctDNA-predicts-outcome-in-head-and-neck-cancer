# Early circulating tumour DNA changes predict outcomes in head and neck cancer patients under re-radiotherapy

## Background
Local recurrence after radiotherapy is common in locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC) patients. Re-irradiation can improve local disease control, but disease progression remains frequent. Hence, predictive biomarkers are needed to adapt treatment intensity to the patient's individual risk. We quantified circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in sequential plasma samples and correlated ctDNA levels with disease outcome.

94 longitudinal plasma samples from 16 locally advanced HNC patients and 57 healthy donors were collected at re-radiotherapy baseline, after 5 and 10 radiation fractions, at irradiation end, and at routine follow-up visits. Plasma DNA was subjected to low coverage whole genome sequencing for copy number variation (CNV) profiling to quantify ctDNA burden.

CNV-based ctDNA burden was detected in 8/16 patients and 25/94 plasma samples. Ten additional ctDNA-positive samples were identified by tracking patient-specific CNVs found in earlier sequential plasma samples. ctDNA-positivity after 5 and 10 radiation fractions (both: log-rank, p = 0.050) as well as at the end of irradiation correlated with short progression-free survival (log-rank, p = 0.006). Moreover, a pronounced decrease of ctDNA towards re-radiotherapy termination was associated with worse treatment outcome (log-rank, p = 0.005). Dynamic ctDNA tracking in serial plasma beyond re-radiotherapy reflected treatment response and imminent disease progression. In 5 patients, molecular progression was detected prior to tumour progression based on clinical imaging.

Our findings emphasise that quantifying ctDNA during re-radiotherapy may contribute to disease monitoring and personalisation of adjuvant treatment, follow-up intervals, and dose prescription.
